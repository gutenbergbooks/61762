<span class="i0">Mount the Arab! Take wet sacking!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wet it must be, mind, not dry;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of the damp and moist’ning rain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How it plays upon the firewood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a pattering ceaseless sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like some grand and glorious music<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sent to soothe the saddened ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take my arm, boy! I feel blinded!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis with joy from such a sight.<br /></span>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">The</span> lights burn in the stable, and I stand in the yard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet thro’ the open window I hear him breathing hard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They watch the bed in silence where Bill the groom lies still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Bill the groom is surely fast going down the hill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas only yestereven, he made a solemn vow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To catch and ride the chestnut; she stands outside there now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While he lies crushed and helpless upon a bed of pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He will not see the sunset behind “The Ridge” again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chestnut’s free and easy, a trifle too thin-skinned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know she isn’t faultless, though sound in limb and wind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I thought she’d give no trouble, for Bill said he could ride,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Australian-born he was not, he came from t’other side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5">{5}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The young ones like to tell us the way they do things there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tho’ I always listen (you know that’s only fair),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wonder what would happen on those great spread-out plains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If when I rode “The Nigger,” I let hang loose his reins.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When Bill first said he’d ride her, I think I did say “no,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We told him all about her, the way that she would go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she had bucked and thrown us whene’er she’d got the chance.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bill leaped the fence and caught her, she led him such a dance!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He put the saddle on her, it was not nearly tight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I ran across and fixed it,&mdash;and he rode out of sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hay-shed hid them from me, I watched them ’long the fence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mare then walked so quietly, I thought she’d learnt some sense;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know he’d got his stirrups, and held the reins quite straight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sat his saddle firmly as he went out the gate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I went and fed his horses, and forked their straw all round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then something seemed to whisper that Bill was on the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought I heard him calling, but when I raised his head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His face was white and fainting, he looked to me quite dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I don’t know how it happened; but there! my eyes grow dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I helped him mount the chestnut,&mdash;and she dealt his death to him.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We brought him in and laid him upon his bed to rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And night and day we’ve waited, just hoping for the best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And done our utmost for him&mdash;the family are away,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The doctor says he cannot see out another day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho’ living’s mostly trouble, my life I’m sure I’d give,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I could bring back yesterday, and let poor Billy live.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’s waking now, they tell me, but not for long, poor lad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he but had his mother, ’twould make his end less sad.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For years they have been parted, yet strange enough it seems,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last night she came in spirit to calm his troubled dreams.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They say she is in England, across the ocean blue:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know she here was watching her boy the long night through.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Don’t say it all was fancy! I’m not a bushman raw;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bill saw her when she entered, first in the open door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He followed every footstep until she reached his bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And caught her hand and held it, as she stroked his tired head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when she rose to leave us, the light, a narrow streak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crept underneath the windows, and tears stole down her cheek;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her face was drooping lowly, it looked so pained and sad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As once her glances rested upon the sleeping lad.<br /></span>
<span class="idt">. . . . . .<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He asks about his horses, and wants to bid good-bye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To “Colonel” and to “Captain,” to “Mill” and “Marjorie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span>”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even to the chestnut! he says it was his fault,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She only bucked just once or twice, and when she seemed to halt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He pulled against the bridle, then up she reared in air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fell right over on him&mdash;he lay beneath her there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, wheel his bed among them and turn them in their stalls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis hard if he can’t see them before his strength quite falls.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They seem to know he’s going&mdash;they lick his outstretched hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he speaks they whinny, the sight is really grand!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when he sees the chestnut (for in the door she stood),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never thought a youngster could be one half as good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He pats her, and he pets her, and strokes her bright red mane;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beast I’m sure is sorry she’s caused him all this pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(I do believe I’m crying, tho’ Bill wears such a smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hardly could be wicked with a face so free from guile).<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">{9}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And there, among the horses, he said he heard a call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho’ everyone kept silent and solemn thro’ it all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His voice once broke the stillness, “That’s not the stable bell?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The angels call me, mother!”&mdash;I caught him as he fell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We did not try to raise him; I saw it was no use;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The horses they were standing, with halters swinging loose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To watch our every movement: we took his bed inside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now I know they’re grieving because poor Bill has died.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Gray</span> shadows speed the fading day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And creeping mists assert their sway;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They rise arrayed in varied hue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From sober black to faintest blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As smoke mounts o’er a slumbering fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or lingers round some funeral pyre.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the fields and in the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where pheasant nestles o’er her brood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sound is heard; the lifeless trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce move their branches in the breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fallen leaves lie curled and damp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where glow-worm shows his tiny lamp.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon too with day the shadowed light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will folded sleep, in arms of night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the marsh and up the hill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wild rabbits scamper with a will.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14">{14}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crimson sun so warm and red<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now sunken lies, in regal bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tinted clouds float gently by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like rose-leaves o’er a painted sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bending river wends its way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through meadows green where oxen stray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It stretches out its lengthy arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which twists and turns past heath and farm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, wild fowl often make their nest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plover, too, with golden crest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From off its banks will fly or run<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the reeds at setting sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The village wrapt in sweet content<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reviews, ere night, the day well spent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cotters lean without their door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To talk with friends the season o’er.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the sward, smooth lies the beach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence mighty waters onward reach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the shore still rippling send<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet murmurings that do not end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So softly do the wavelets move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They seem to breathe but words of love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if they feared or trembled, lest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They hurt one shell upon its breast;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15">{15}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or cast one pebble on the sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest it should know their strength of hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus fades the day before my sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While nature waits the coming night.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And sea-birds flecked the foaming spray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the deep. The waves now dashed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rolling huge, so heavily lashed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their watery fleece against the strand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But yesterday, with loving hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They laved its face with warm caress,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The glowing sun, which blessed that day,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And stinging sleet, that blew so fierce,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The smallest floweret seemed to pierce;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tossed aside the golden sheaf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or cut like steel each tiny leaf.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16">{16}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Uprooted trees as there they stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then threw them down among the gorse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crushed the ferns with cruel force.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, whistling by the sea-girt dale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It caused the fisherwife to pale;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made the worn-out rafters quake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sleepers suddenly awake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The busy smacksmen set their sail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trim their boats to ride the gale;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While aged seamen creep in sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To glean the dangers of the night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They long to join the gallant band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though wan of face and weak of hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gaze upon the angry sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which stirs the fading memory<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bring some peril past to each,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lesson new, their age to teach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When walking back to humble cot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each ache and ailment is forgot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17">{17}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in their homes the threadbare tale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wreck and rescue will not fail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hours to enliven thro’ the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chase aside the shadows gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, round their lives’ uncertain sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now deepen where the warnings be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of one last voyage which must be made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere sailings be for ever stayed.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So lowly set, where stirs a faint warm breeze.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Though venturing nearer, veils her face from sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Patient awaiting that belovèd hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When like a queen, she rises, full of power,<br /></span>
